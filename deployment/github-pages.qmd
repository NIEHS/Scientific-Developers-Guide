## Introduction

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can use GitHub Pages to host a website about yourself, your organization, or project directly from a GitHub repository.

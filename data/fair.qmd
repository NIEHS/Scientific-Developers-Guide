## Introduction

The FAIR Data Principles are a set of guidelines designed to enhance the reusability of scientific data. The principles were developed in 2016 by a group of stakeholders from academia, industry, and government. The FAIR Data Principles are intended to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).

The FAIR Data Principles are based on the idea that data should be treated as a valuable asset that can be reused and repurposed. By following the FAIR Data Principles, researchers can ensure that their data is easily discoverable, accessible, and usable by others.

## Introduction

Data sharing is the practice of making research data available to other researchers, institutions, or the public. Sharing data has become increasingly important in scientific research, as it promotes transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration. By sharing data, researchers can validate and build upon each other's work, accelerating the pace of discovery and innovation.

    "text": "Potential Issues\nThe basic installation instructions failed for a couple of reasons.\nFirst was a problem with channel priority settings. To deal with that I created a new empty environment and applied a configuration change specifically to that (namely flexible channel priority).\n[cnxxxx]$ mamba create -n openfold\n[cnxxxx]$ mamba activate openfold\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ conda config --env --set channel_priority flexible\nNext, some changes to the environment.yml file. Note that the patch commands use here docs so they span several lines until (and including) the line that contains the end marker for the here doc (EOF in this case). Basically I want to insert a line that excludes the default conda channels and one that includes the cudatoolkit-dev=11.* package:\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ patch &lt;&lt;__EOF__\n--- environment.yml\n+++ environment.yml\n@@ -3,6 +3,7 @@ channels:\n   - conda-forge\n   - bioconda\n   - pytorch\n+  - nodefaults\n dependencies:\n   - python=3.9\n   - libgcc=7.2\n@@ -31,6 +32,7 @@ dependencies:\n   - bioconda::kalign2==2.04\n   - bioconda::mmseqs2\n   - pytorch::pytorch=1.12.*\n+  - cudatoolkit-dev=11.*\n   - pip:\n       - deepspeed==0.12.4\n       - dm-tree==0.1.6\n__EOF__\nTo avoid confusion i attached the modified environment.yml file. Then install all the prerequisites:\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ mamba env update -n openfold -f environment.yml\nNext, install third party dependencies and parameters. That script needs some modifications as well.\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ patch -p0 &lt;&lt;'__EOF__'\n--- scripts/install_third_party_dependencies.sh\n+++ scripts/install_third_party_dependencies.sh\n@@ -19,6 +19,5 @@ conda env config vars set CUTLASS_PATH=$PWD/cutlass\n\n # This setting is used to fix a worker assignment issue during data loading  conda env config vars set KMP_AFFINITY=none\n-\n-export LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH\n-export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n+conda env config vars set LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib conda env\n+config vars set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib\n__EOF__\n\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ scripts/install_third_party_dependencies.sh\nAgain, I attached the modified script. If you want to modify this code, easily you might also want to modify the python setup.py install line to do an editable install which might make it easier for you.This just depends on your personal workflow preferences.\nDeactivate and reactivate to make sure the settings from the conda environment are applied.\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ conda deactivate\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ conda activate openfold\nDownload the parameters.\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ ./scripts/download_openfold_params.sh openfold/resources\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ ./scripts/download_alphafold_params.sh openfold/resources\nNow we’re done with the installation. All you need to do when you want to run is to activate the environment and, for ease of use, change into the OpenFold install directory.\nFor this example, we’re already in the install dir and the environment is already activated.\nRun an inference with alphafold parameters, model 1, without precomputed MSAs.\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ mkdir -p test_out\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ BASE_DATA_DIR=/gs12/users/alphafold2\n\n(openfold)[cnxxxx]$ python3 run_pretrained_openfold.py \\\n    examples/monomer/fasta_dir \\\n    $BASE_DATA_DIR/pdb_mmcif/mmcif_files \\\n    --output_dir test_out \\\n    --config_preset model_1_ptm \\\n    --uniref90_database_path $BASE_DATA_DIR/uniref90/uniref90.fasta \\\n    --mgnify_database_path $BASE_DATA_DIR/mgnify/mgy_clusters.fa \\\n    --pdb70_database_path $BASE_DATA_DIR/pdb70/pdb70 \\\n    --uniclust30_database_path $BASE_DATA_DIR/uniref30/UniRef30_2021_06 \\\n    --bfd_database_path $BASE_DATA_DIR/bfd/bfd_metaclust_clu_complete_id30_c90_final_seq.sorted_opt \\\n    --model_device \"cuda:0\"\nRun inference with alphafold params with precomputed MSAs - run second model.\npython3 run_pretrained_openfold.py examples/monomer/fasta_dir \\\n  $BASE_DATA_DIR/pdb_mmcif/mmcif_files \\\n  --output_dir test_out \\\n  --use_precomputed_alignments test_out/alignments \\\n  --config_preset model_2_ptm \\\n  --model_device \"cuda:0\"\nNote that this will overwrite the timings.json files. And it doesn’t look like you can specify more than one preset per execution. It is a bit awkward.\nRun inference with openfold params.\nmkdir -p test_out2\npython3 run_pretrained_openfold.py examples/monomer/fasta_dir \\\n  $BASE_DATA_DIR/pdb_mmcif/mmcif_files \\\n  --output_dir test_out2 \\\n  --openfold_checkpoint_path=./openfold/resources/openfold_params/finetuning_ptm_1.pt \\\n  --use_precomputed_alignments test_out/alignments \\\n  --config_preset model_1_ptm \\\n  --model_device \"cuda:0\"\nOpenFold docs aren’t great as far as the existing scripts go, so I’m a little unclear how the config_presets interact with the params.\nGenerally I followed the example here: https://openfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Inference.html\nYou might want to separate alignment generation, which does not require GPU, and model inference. Alignment generation in the examples above took most the time."

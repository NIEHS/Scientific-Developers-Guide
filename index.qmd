Welcome to the Scientific Developers Guide. This guide is intended to provide a set of best practices and guidelines for developing scientific software at NIH.

## What is a "Scientific Developer"?

![](/media/scientific-developer.jpg)

What constitutes a **"scientific developer"**? These are people who typically:

- use R or Python (or Julia, MATLAB, SAS, etc...) to [analyze](/analysis/index.qmd) scientific data
- utilize [scientific notebooks](/analysis/scientific-notebooks.qmd) and publishing tools such as Jupyter, RMarkdown, Quarto, LaTeX, etc., to analyze data and create publications
- use [high-performance computing (HPC)](/computing/index.qmd) to enable [analytical pipelines](/analysis/workflows.qmd)
- store and interact with large amounts of [data](/data/index.qmd), including GB or TB (or even larger!) datasets
- [create plots](/analysis/visualization.qmd) of all kinds and share their results in interactive ways (hello Shiny!)

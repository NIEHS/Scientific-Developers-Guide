## Introduction

Deployment is the process of making software applications available to users. This involves taking the code that has been developed and making it accessible to users in a production environment. Deployment can involve a variety of tasks, such as setting up servers, configuring databases, and ensuring that the application is running smoothly. There are many different deployment strategies that can be used, depending on the needs of the application and the organization. These strategies can include manual deployments, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), and more. Deployment is a critical part of the software development lifecycle, as it is the final step in getting software into the hands of users.

## Introduction

Workflows and pipelines are essential tools for automating and streamlining data analysis and computational tasks. They help researchers and developers manage complex processes, track dependencies, and ensure reproducibility. By defining a series of steps and dependencies, workflows and pipelines can be executed sequentially or in parallel, enabling efficient data processing and analysis.
